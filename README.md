# r-template readme

Template repository for R analysis projects.
The src/main.R should be used to run all scripts end to end. This makes work reproducable and easy to run for other people. 

The project working directory should be set to the folder location of the repository manually, before running.

The gitignore file has been set up for generic R projects however, more files/folders can be included.
