# Source folder set-up

The source folder has the following set-up:
- `config.R`
    - *All the path names for the scripts*
- `init.R`
    - *A bit like the preamble in RMd*
- `main.R`
    - *Runs the analyses end-to-end.R file*
- `misc_functions.R`
    - *Write all the important functions you use in your script once and then load them when needed*
- `packages.R`
    - *Loads the packages in the right order*
